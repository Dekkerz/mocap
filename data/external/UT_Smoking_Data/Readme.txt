There are total 11 participants for smoking data. Each file shows data for each participant. Such as Has_Data, Sho_Data etc. There are some extra files for 4 participants with shortcuts such as SW(smoking while walking:SmokeWK), SG(smoking in a group:SmokeGP), and W ( just walking:walk). These four participants performed extra activities. All the particitantname_Data files contains the standard activities such as smoking while sitting (SmokeST), smoking while standing(SmokeSD), Eating, Drinking while sitting (DrinkST), drinking while standing (DrinkSD), standing (Stand), and sitting (Sit). 

Within each file, the first part is watch data, then empty colum and then phone data.  The order is as follows:

Watch Data:
timestamp, Accelerometer(x,y,z), Linear acceleration sensor(x,y,z), Gyroscope(x,y,z),magnetometer(x,y,z), pressure sensor, heartratesensor

Empty colum

Phone Data:
timestamp, Accelerometer(x,y,z), Linear acceleration sensor(x,y,z), Gyroscope(x,y,z),magnetometer(x,y,z), gps(lat, long)

Last coulmn is the class label.
